CrossChat
============

Want to learn a new technology\framework\language\etc ? - write a chat app! So did I. This app allows anyone to chat (and even to send images!) in the global chat room on his **WP8**, **iOS** or **Android** smartphone.
  
Server side is built using **DDD** approach, data is stored in SQL using Entity Framework Code First, and transmitted using low level sockets (I created my own WCF :)

Client side is built using amazing **Xamarin.Forms** with MVVM approach.
